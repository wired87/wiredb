# Publish BestBrain to the OpenAI App Store

All requirements and data are prepared. Follow these steps to submit the app.

## 1. Run the workflow (already done)

```bash
py -m _admin.main --publish-app --publish-app-no-docker
```

This validates metadata, tools, MCP server, and writes **app_submission_manifest.json** with every field needed for the form.

## 2. Deploy the MCP server to a public HTTPS URL

- **Option A:** Deploy the Docker image to Cloud Run / Fly.io / Render and note the base URL.
- **Option B:** For testing, run `ngrok http 8787` and use `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok.app`.

The Connector URL you will paste in the form must be: **https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/mcp**

## 3. Submit at the OpenAI Platform

1. Open **https://platform.openai.com/apps-manage**
2. Click **Submit for review**
3. Fill the form using the data in **app_submission_manifest.json**:
